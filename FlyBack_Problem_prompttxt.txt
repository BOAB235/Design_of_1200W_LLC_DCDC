You are expert on power electronic 
You must making internet search 
Think step by step 
if you don't have response, juste don't lose my time 
I want validated response, and not halocination 

I'm designing a flyback 400v/12v-1A 
# details 
control circuit: TNY280GN
### Transformer 
Planer PCB winding transformer 
Primary : 8 Tr 
Secondary : 1 Tr 
Core : ELP 22/6/16 with I 22/2.5/16 N87
in the datasheet AL=5200 nH/tr2
L = AL * N**2 = 5200*8**2/1000=332uH
in low voltage measurement 50 ohm, i found 136uH (i don't know why) 
#### Primary snubber :
R = 82kR 2W in parallel with 10nF 630V, both in serial with 600V diode 1A US1J 
#### Secondary 
diode 40v 3A + capa 470uF 35V 
Optocopler + ziner 11V + resistors to drive EN pin of TNY280GN

# Test 
I powered my flyback with 320V DC 
i see i streange behaviour 
- The fly back start each time 
run like 10 to 20 cycle with frequ close to 130kHz and heigh duty cycle (like 90%) 
and stop, this cycle is repeted each x ms , this repetition cause an audible sound that i can lesten to it 
The DC voltage in the output is close to 1.5V instead of 12V that i expect 


# What can cause this problem 
I make a quick calculation 
L = 135uH , freq = 130kHz , duty = 90% , 320V 
==> I_prim_max = 400/(130e3*0.9*135e-6)= 25A 
I don't know if my resonement is valide but 25A in primary is a lot 
Could you please help me identifing the problem
