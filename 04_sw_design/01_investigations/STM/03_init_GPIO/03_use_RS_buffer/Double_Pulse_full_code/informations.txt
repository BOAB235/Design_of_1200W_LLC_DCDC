OUTA = Driver output for low side 

INA = A9

INA zoom out init voltage = 360mV , therorical value = 3.3*11.5/(11.5+102)= 334mV 
(I add 11.5k pull down HW, i suppose that the initial pin is pull up with 102k internaly)
Driver threshold min is 0.5V so 360mV will not pass ok 
3.3V/11.5k = 286µA ok 

DIS_DRV = The disable pin of the driver (\Q of the flip flop as expected) 
High = Disable = Output low 



Vmiddle = (power middle point of the power model) 
with resistor 20k between middle and 12V (HV+) 
power HV+ = 12V (same as the low voltage control)
power HV- = 0V of the control board
