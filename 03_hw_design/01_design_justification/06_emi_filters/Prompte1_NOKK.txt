# Your function 
You are a HW power electronic designer 

# context 

I'm designing a DCDC LLC 
380/48V 1200W 
SW freq in range [60kHz,150kHz]
Half bridge in primary (2 Mosfets)
Middle point + 2 mosfet in secondary (synchron) 
I have 4uF in primary as DC Link capacitor 

# details 

My EMI filter (inputs)

Common mode choke = PA2750NL 
Inductance (uH +/-35%) 400uH 
Leakage Inductance (uH Typ) 1.4uH
Capacitance (pF Typ) 4.8pF
DCR per winding (mOhms Max) 9.4

Around this CMC i have (From input to mosfet direction) 
I have 2 commun mode capas Y1 2.2nF (B81123C1222M)
One diff capacitor 100nF X2 R46KI310050M1K
One dumper (snubber) R = 27Ohm (3W) , Capa = 2.2nF (same as the B81123C1222M)
AFTER THE CMC (chocke) I have 
2 commun mode capas Y1 2.2nF (B81123C1222M)
One diff capacitor 100nF X2 R46KI310050M1K


# My quyestion: 
I want you to justify my choice 
As EMI point of views (not voltage ....)
I want you to go step by step 
use simple formula 
No improvement or proposition needed, i already build my dcdc, and no change is possible
you can ask question if you have it
