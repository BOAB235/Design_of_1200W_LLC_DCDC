# Montage plan

- Mount only wire instead of CMC without capa... 

- Mount Micro +12V to 3.3V buck+ Driver + Input Mosfet  (no Cr mounted)
  
  - Test DOUBLE PULSE 
  
  - Carac Inductor Lm Lr 
  
  - Zth (to be confirmed)
  
  - Use external 12V power supplay 

- Mount all small capacitor (ceramic)+ small resistor 

- Mount 400V TO 12V/12 flyback ==> test 
  
  - Mount 12V/3.3V buck ==> test 
  
  - MOUN
  
  - Desable flyback (sort circuit T18 / GND_ISO)

- Mount the secondary mosfet + Output capa (no secon driver)
  
  - Test the frequency response of the system in low voltage 40V input
